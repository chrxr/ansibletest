# Hosts file replaced on dev only, as 127.0.0.1 is a loopback so doesn't
# work with forwarded ports on Vagrant when using Apache. On QA/PRD should still
# use 127.0.0.1

0.0.0.0 localhost
# 127.0.0.1 localhost

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
